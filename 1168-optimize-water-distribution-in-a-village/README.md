<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/optimize-water-distribution-in-a-village/">1168. Optimize Water Distribution in a Village</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><div><p>There are <code>n</code> houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.</p>

<p>For each house <code>i</code>, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost <code>wells[i - 1]</code> (note the <code>-1</code> due to <strong>0-indexing</strong>), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array <code>pipes</code> where each <code>pipes[j] = [house1<sub>j</sub>, house2<sub>j</sub>, cost<sub>j</sub>]</code> represents the cost to connect <code>house1<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>house2<sub>j</sub></code> together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two houses with different costs.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/22/1359_ex1.png" style="width: 189px; height: 196px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, wells = [1,1], pipes = [[1,2,1],[1,2,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can supply water with cost two using one of the three options:
Option 1:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 2:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 2 with house 1 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 3:
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 1 with house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Note that we can connect houses 1 and 2 with cost 1 or with cost 2 but we will always choose <strong>the cheapest option</strong>.
